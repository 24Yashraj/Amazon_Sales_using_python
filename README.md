# Amazon_Sales_using_python

Conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis on the Amazon sales dataset, with a primary focus on understanding sales trends and customer behavior. The project involved rigorous data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability. Utilized a range of Python libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization, and numpy for numerical operations. The objective was to identify key patterns and insights that could drive strategic business decisions. This foundational analysis set the stage for further detailed examination and reporting.

  
Through the analysis, it was revealed that T-shirts are the highest-selling product, making up nearly 50% of total sales. Additionally, there was a significant 20% increase in sales for clothing sizes ranging from M to XXL. Geographically, Maharashtra stood out as the leading region in terms of sales volume. Furthermore, the buyer demographics showed that 99.2% of the purchasers are retailers, while a smaller segment, 0.8%, comprises B2B buyers. These findings highlight critical areas for targeted marketing and inventory management.

 
The project provided comprehensive insights into product demand, size preferences, and regional sales distribution. The analysis supports the need for strategic decisions in targeted marketing campaigns and optimized inventory management. By understanding these patterns, the business can better cater to customer preferences and improve overall sales performance. The detailed insights gained from this project also set a precedent for future data-driven decision-making processes. This project underscores the value of thorough data analysis in uncovering actionable business insights.
